## Running instructions

We conduct experiments with real-world data, and simulated data.

To train the models and evaluate their performance on the real world data, we use the commercial suite for AutoML [JADBio](https://jadbio.com/).
With access to their paid API, to reproduce the results, just execute in order the files ./code/real_data_<#>.py, from 1 to 5.
Without access to the JADBio API, we provide the evaluation output at the aforementioned link, and the intermediate analysis in the folder ./output/ and also the final results in the final_results.xlsx file.

To reproduce the results with the simulated data, here it is an example.
To change the simulated data hyperparameter, modify the lines 7-12 in the file ./code/simulation_1_data.py

### Example
Turn on the created python environment and run the following code from the ./code/ folder:
```bash
python simulation_1_data.py
python simulation_2_apply_BBC_on_data.py
python simulation_3_calculate_CI.py
```
At this point, the R code from ./code/R_code/ folder needs to be run.
In case there are some problems with R, we provided the expected output in the /output/ folder.
Then:
```bash
python simulation4_combine_with_R_results.py
```
Now, you should have a folder with all the results. 
For simplicty, we summarize them in an excel file (/output/final_results.xlsx), where we compute the p-score and ranking.
Finally, to reproduce the plots, just run:
```bash
python plot_results/plot_results.py
```

-----
To reproduce the time-complexity analysis of BBC and BBC-F. Execute the following command:
```bash
python plot_results/bbc_time_analysis.py
```
Then, the produced plots and logs should be found in the folder /output/time_analsys/ .

Anyway, we provide all our intermediate and final results of our experiments in /output/ folder.
