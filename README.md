# Condifence Interval Estimation of Predictive Performance in the Context of AutoML

Scripts "BBC_parallel.py", "compare_pooledBBC_foldBBC.py", "compute_CI_test.py", "generate_data.py", "make_API_configuration.py", and "read_JAD_output.py" contain code that is either loaded by the main scripts we will discuss below, or code that is not used at all for this paper.

-----

The folder "fastAUC" contains a faster implementation (compared to the standard python sklearn implementation) of the AUC metric.

-----

The main scripts are grouped into two categories: "simulation" and "real_data". Each category contains the scripts numbered in the order they need to be applied.

Simulation:
- "simulation_1_data.py" simulates the configuration performances, outcomes, out-of-sample predictions, and fold indices for the various simulation settings presented in the paper and stores them as csv files in a dedicated folder.
- "simulation_2_apply_BBC_on_data.py" applies the two BBC methods (original and BBC-F) on the simulated predictions from the previous step and stores the resulting bootstrap distributions and the theoreticl performqnces of the selected configurations in a dedicated folder.
- "simulation_3_calculate_CI" takes the output from the previous step and calculates the one-sided 95% CI for all cases and the inclusion percentages and the average tightness in each case and stores all results.
- "simulation_4_combine_with_R_results.py" combines the results on the two BBC methods and the results from the R-code (discussed later) on the rest of the methods.

Real data:
- "real_data_1_splits" imports the datasets (downloaded from OpenML) from a folder in arff. format, creates 100 different stratified train/holdout splits and saves the split indices in a dedicated folder.
- "real_data_2_run_on_JAD.py" uploads for each dataset the various training subsets from the previous step and runs the analysis on JADBio. Then it stores the resulting outcome, out-of-sample predictions, fold indices, and descriptions of the applied configurations. This step cannot be run without special API access to JADBio.
- "real_data_3_apply_BBC_on_data.py" applies the two BBC methods on the results from the previous step and stores the best configuration for each JADBio analysis and the corresponding botstrap distributions.
- "real_data_4_evaluation_on_JAD" uploads for each dataset/split the holdout dataset and runs the winner configuration to get the holdout performances.
- "real_data_5_calculate_CI" takes the resuls of the previous steps, along with the corresponding results from the R-code run on the same out-of-sample predictions for the comparison methods, and calculates the inclusion percentages and the average tightnesses and stores the results.

Below are some notes on the R-code provided by the authors of "Post-Selection Confidence Bounds for Prediction Performance. 422 2023. arXiv: 2210.13206 [stat.ML]", used to apply the comparison methods in our paper. (https://github.com/pascalrink/mabt-experiments?tab=readme-ov-file).

The R scripts "MabtCi-function.R" and "TiltCi-function.R" contain the functions for applying the MABT and BT methods and are loaded by the other two scripts "simulated_data.R" and "real_datasets.R". 

"simulated_data.R" loads the data simulated by "simulation_1_data.py" above and applies all comparison methods to our BBC methods. It calculates the 95% one-sided CI's, along with the corresponding "winner configurations" in each case and stores them. The results are then loaded by "simulation_4_combine_with_R_results.py" as mentioned above.

"real_datasets.R" loads the JADBio output on the real datasets stored by "real_data_2_run_on_JAD.py" above and calculates the 95% intervals for all datasets and all splits, along with the corresponding "winner configurations" and stores the results.

-----

The script "plot_results.py" generates the plots found in the paper. As input it requires the excel file "BBC vs MABT.xlsx" that has a summary of the experimental results.

The script "bbc_time_analysis.py" computes the runtime analysis between the pooled and the fold-BBC.
